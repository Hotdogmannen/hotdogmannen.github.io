                        This is a tool I made in the S&box game engine to get a better understanding of how the editor side of the engine worked. 
                        I started using this engine to better my knowledge on other game engines and have some good ol’ F. U. N. 
                        I wanted to create an easy to use dialogue system where no code was needed to use it (except for UI as the engine only supports creating it in code). 
                        This meant creating an editor from which the user can make the dialogue and I also had to create the systems that runs the dialogue during runtime. 
                        I learnt a lot about the engine and more importantly how to dig through engine code to find out how things worked as there isn’t much documentation 
                        on the editor side of things.

                    <h2 class="subsectionTitle">Dialogue System</h2>
                    <p class="aboutMechanic-text">
                        Chit Chat is a stack based dialogue system which means that the dialogue data is built up from a stack of actions. 
                        There are 3 different actions the user can choose from, these are the speak, event and choice action. The speak action is
                        used for when a character is speaking (duh) and has options to add a writing effect, character picture as well as sounds. 
                        The event action is used to send an event from dialogue to objects in the scene. And lastly the choice action is used to add 
                        choices to the player that can lead to other dialogue. The actions use a base class that implements a simple function that passes 
                        in all systems a dialogue action can use, this means that no casting is necessary and new actions can easily be implemented.

                <div class="aboutMechanic-container">
                    <h2 class="subsectionTitle">Custom Editor</h2>
                    <p class="aboutMechanic-text">
                        The editor for Chit Chat is built up from 3 windows, these are the dialogue selector, dialogue inspector and the templates window. 
                        The dialogue selector is where the user adds or removes actions and also selects them. When an action is selected the dialogue inspector 
                        will show the different options for that action. The template window is used to set templates for the different actions, it’s like the default state of an action.

                        A tool's usability is really important, making sure it's easy to learn and use had me drawing tons in paint. 
                        Something I added to make Chit Chat easier to use was the template window as I wanted the user to have control over the default 
                        state of actions as the one I created isn’t going to work for everyone. I also made examples and guides on how to use the tool making 
                        it easier for someone to use it. I even created a built-in UI that can be used or modified but most importantly something the user can 
                        reference when making their own UI.
